TO DO:

Minor:
 - Sidebar responsiveness in viewport size
 - Add backdrop in sidebar (Mobile)
 - Minor bug: PNC logo and icons are showing on sidebar collapse then disappears (Mobile)
 - Fix Session in Back Button in /forgot-password and /reset-password/{token}
 - Fix session expires throws 419 after clicking login and logout button
 - Fix table component x overflow gets cut off in main content


Major:
 - Create a middleware for not allowing to go back to the login page after validation (Browser's Back Button)
 - Implement the designed restoration process considering duplicate entry (Overwriting Process) (see Diagrams for reference)
 - Cascade soft delete
 - In force deleting, do not log DELETED event, only log FORCE_DELETED event
 - Make batch logging, e.g., Relationship: Users <---> Employee, when performed actions (like delete, edit, etc.) to Users it will also log changes to Employee's values in a single activity log



Notes:
 - Use Laravel Mix
 - Use Livewire
 - Use Spatie
 - Use ChartJS


Common Resource Routes:
index   - show all

store   - store new (form with inputs)
edit    - show form to edit (show form for modifying input)
update  - update (submit for with changes to inputs)
delete - show delete confirmation modal
destroy - delete data (archive)
